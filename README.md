# C# 101

## Introduction

This is a one week course to introduce you to the basics of C# Console Programming. We will start with a classic `Hello World`-Application, make our way through concepts like types, operations, code-flow and arrays and finish this course with our first game.

# Grading

The grading allows you to skip the exercises, if you are confident enough.\
I recommend following this path:
- Beginner: Work your way through all exercises and then try yourself at implementing Nim.
- Intermediate: You may start implementing Nim right away and then try Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Advanced: Better score some save points with Nim first, but then you may try Battleships. But careful: it's challenging!

| Official Grade | Internal Grade  |  Requirement |
|--------------|-------|:-------------|
|VG|Summa Cum laude (A*)| Completed the Nim-Game assignment near-flawlessly including a smart and a simple A.I., or Tic-Tac-Toe or Battleships satisfyingly. |
|VG| Magna Cum Laude (A)| Completed the Nim-Game assignment including one A.I. player. |
|VG|Cum Laude (B)| Completed the Nim-Game assignment in a clean, playable state. |
|G|Passed (C)| Completed all exercises including the Nim game assignment, even if the code contains bugs / flaws. |
|G|Barely Passed (D)| Put in an effort of solving all exercises which did not involve implementing a whole game. |
|U|Insufficient (E)| Put in a visible effort of solving the exercises. |
|U|Failed (F)| Did not hand in any code. |
