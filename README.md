# 102 - CSharp Basics

## Goal

This course will introduce you to the basics of C# Console Programming. We will start with a classic `Hello World`-Application, make our way through concepts like types, operations, code-flow and finish this course with our first game.

# Grading

The grading allows you to skip the exercises, if you are confident enough.\

I recommend following this path:
- Beginner: Work your way through all exercises and then try yourself at implementing Nim.
- Intermediate: You may start implementing Nim right away and then try Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Advanced: Better score some save points with Nim first, but then you may try Battleships. Words of advice: Don't expect to finish the latter.

## Passing Criteria
- Completed all exercises up to Nim Assignment.

## Excellent Criteria
- Completed Nim Game including an AI Player.

## Bonus Criteria
- Implemented a smart (unbeatable) AI.

# 4 Go To
## Goal
Learn about how we can go back in time (well at least lines of code) by using `goto`. This will allow us to run the same line(s) of code a second time. Or a hundredth. Or forever.

# 5 Game On
## Goal
Recap everything that you have learned this week through an advanced exercise. Pick either the Nim-Game, the Tic-Tac-Toe-Game or the Battleship-Game depending on your confidence in your abilities.\
You are allowed to complete all three games, if you feel that you are up for the challenge.
