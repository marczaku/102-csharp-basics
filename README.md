## Introduction

This is a one week course to introduce you to the very basics of C# Console Programming. This week's course will conclude with a final assignment of implementing `Nim` as a Console Application and a bonus assignment for implementing either Tic-Tac-Toe or Battleships, too.


# Grading

For the grading, all other exercises don't matter, so you may go ahead and skip straight to the juicy stuff.\
But then again, all these exercises are meant to exercise one element of the language that you just learnt through the slides, and give you the opportunity to test, if you have really understood what it's about.

| Official Grade | Internal Grade  |  Requirement |
|--------------|-------|:-------------|
|VG|Summa Cum laude (A*)| Completed the Battleships game. |
|VG| Magna Cum Laude (A)| Completed the Tic-Tac-Toe game. |

|G|Passed (C)| Completed all exercises including the Nim game, even if the code contains bugs / flaws. |
|G|Barely Passed (D)| Put in an effort of solving all exercises which did not involve implementing a whole game. |
|U|Insufficient (E)| Put in a visible effort of solving the exercises. |
|U|Failed (F)| Did not hand in any code. |
