## 1 - Printing Output: 
[Read the Slides on Printing Output](../slides/003.3.1-console-basics-1.md#1-printing-output)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P1PrintingOutput`
- Delete all of the contents of `Program.cs`
- Write a Hello World console application from scratch.

Like really, try it, once! Start with `Console.WriteLine` without a class and main method. Now, add a class named `Program` with a `static` `void` Method named `Main` and move the `Console.WriteLine` into that method. Can you put the `Program` class into  a `namespace`?
### Sample
```
Output:Hello World
```

## 2 - Comments: 
[Read the Slides on Comments](../slides/003.3.1-console-basics-1.md#2-comments)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P2Comments`
- Add xml documentation to your main method. Describe, what a Main Method is and what it does.
- Add a comment above your Hello World Output to explain, what it does.
- add 3 lines of a comment in the top of the file to list up 
  - the author of the file
  - the date
  - your e-mail address 
  - (this is common practice in a bunch of companies, but has become kind of obsolete due to Version Control Systems providing the same information)
### Sample
```
Output:Hello World
```

## 3 - Variables: 
[Read the Slides on Variables](../slides/003.3.1-console-basics-1.md#3-variables)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P3Variables`
- assign the value 5 to a variable named `number` 
- then output the variable to the console
### Sample
```
Output:5
```

## 4 - Basic Data Types: 
[Read the Slides on Basic Data Types](../slides/003.3.1-console-basics-1.md#4-basic-data-types)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P4DataTypes`
- Assign the value Hello World to a variable named `outputString` - Then print it to the Console 
- Assign 0.3 to a float variable named `decimalValue` 
- Print it to the Console 
- Assign the value true to a bool variable named `isAwesome` 
- Print it to the Console
- Assign a7 in hexadecimal to a byte named `hexByte` 
- Print it to the Console
### Sample
```
Output:Hello World
Output:0.3
Output:True
Output:167
```


## 5 - Conversion: 
[Read the Slides on Conversion](../slides/003.3.1-console-basics-1.md#5-conversion)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P5Conversion`
- Assign 5 to a variable named `number`. 
- Convert that number to a string and assign the value to a variable named `numberString` 
- Print the value of `numberString` to the Console
- Assign `"56.3"` to `numberString`
- Now, convert the `numberString` to an integer again and assign it to `number` 
- Print the value of `number` to the Console
### Sample
```
Output:5
Output:56
```

## 6 - Reading Input: 
[Read the Slides on Input](../slides/003.3.1-console-basics-1.md#6-reading-input)

## 7 - Operators: 
[Read the Slides on Oprators](../slides/003.3.1-console-basics-1.md#7-operators)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P7Operators`
- Solve this Mathematic problem using code and output the result: 

```
Add 7 to 5, multiply the result with 3, subtract 6 from that, divide that result by 1.2 and then take the remainder after division with 17 from that
```
- Be careful about the order of execution here!!
  - (remember from Maths classes? Multiplication before Addition etc.?)
- Hint: There is an operator that gets you the remainder after division
### Sample
```
Output:8
```
