# Assignments 003.3.3 Console Basics 3

For all of these exercises, it is recommended to:
- Open GitHub Desktop Application
- Select your Assignment Repository (named `gp21-21-0927-csharp-basics-nim-[yourusername]`)
- Then, from the Menu Bar in GitHub Desktop, select `Repository` > `Open in Terminal` (or `Open in Command Prompt`)
- Create a Project using `dotnet new console -o ProjectName` (replace the Project Name with the name given by each Exercise)
- Add a `.gitignore` to the folder of the newly created Project:
  - First, navigate to the new folder: `cd [ProjectName]`
  - Then, use `dotnet new gitignore`
  - Do NOT commit any files in `/bin/` or `/obj/`, please!
- Open the Project in the IDE of your choice. Remember: Open the `.csproj` file!!
- Then follow the instructions of the exercise

## 14 - For-Loops: 
[Read the Slides on For-Loops](../slides/003.3.3-console-basics-3.md#14-for-loop)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P14ForLoops`
- Use a for-loop to count from 1 to 1000
- Use a for-loop to count from 200 to 100
- Use a for-loop that starts at 1024, always divides the number by 2, until it reaches 1, then it stops
### Sample
```
Output:1
Output:2
...
Output:999
Output:1000
Output:200
Output:199
...
Output:101
Output:100
Output:1024
Output:512
Output:256
...
Output:4
Output:2
Output:1
```

## 15 - Break & Continue: 
[Read the Slides on Break & Continue](../slides/003.3.3-console-basics-3.md#15-break--continue)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P15BreakContinue`
- Implement an over-simplified game of blackjack: 
- Player Phase:
  - Every turn pick a random number between 1 and 11
  - Add it to the sum of numbers, which starts at zero
  - If the sum is greater than 21, the player loses
  - If it’s 21, then the player wins
  - Ask the Player each time, if he wants to continue drawing
  - If the player decides, not to continue drawing, then the dealer draws:
- Dealer Phase:
- the dealer draws after the same rules as the player
- but has to draw until he reaches 17 points
- or until he has a higher score than the player
- if he has a number higher than 21, the player wins
- if he has a higher number than the player, then the player loses
- if the has a lower number than the player, the player wins
- if it’s the same number, then it’s a draw
### Sample
```
Output:Welcome to Blackjack!
Output:You draw a 7, for a total of 7. Continue drawing? y/n
Input:y
Output:You draw a 11, for a total of 18. Continue drawing? y/n
Input:n
Output:The dealer draws a 3, for a total of 7.
Output:The dealer draws a 9, for a total of 12.
Output:The dealer draws a 5, for a total of 17.
Output:The dealer draws a 6, for a total of 23.
Output:The dealer drew more than 21. The player wins.
Output:Welcome to Blackjack!

## 16 - Arrays
[Read the Slides on Arrays](../slides/003.3.3-console-basics-3.md#17-arrays)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P16Arrays`
- Create an array to count the occurrences of random numbers
- roll 10.000 times for a number between 0 and 10 
- and count the number of times that you have rolled that specific number
- Afterwards, print the result to the console.
### Sample
```
Output:I will roll 10.000 numbers between 0 and 10:
Output:I rolled 0 a total of 987 times.
Output:I rolled 1 a total of 1002 times.
Output:I rolled 1 a total of 998 times.
...
```
