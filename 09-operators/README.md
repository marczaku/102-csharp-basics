# Exercises 9 - Operators: 

## Final Exercise

Recommendation: Skip for now and do it later. Instead do the other exercises below first.

### Goal
```
Output:Give me a number of seconds
Input:123456
Output:Seconds: 36
Output:Minutes: 17
Output:Hours: 10
Output:Days: 1
Output:1.10:17:36
Output:In total, that's 1,4288888888888887 Days.
```

### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P09Operators` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Solve this Mathematical problem using code and output the result: 

- Ask the user for an amount of seconds
- Simplify the time:
- Calculate, how many days, hours, minutes and seconds the time contains
  - You need Division and Remainder after Division!
- Print each part of the time
- Then, print all components together in the format `D.H:M:S`
  - `D`ays
  - `H`ours
  - `M`inutes
  - `S`econds
- Then, print how many days that is in total as a fraction

## P09_01SpeedConverter

Implement a program that takes an input for km/h and displays the result in m/s.
- Input: `72`
- Output: `20`

## P09_02MinutesToSeconds

Implement a program that takes an integer input for minutes and displays the result in seconds.
- Input: `3`
- Output: `180`

## P09_03Division
Implement a program that takes two integers as input and displays their division result as a float.
- Input: `11`, `4`
- Output: `2,75`

## P09_04Remainder
Write a program that calculates the remainder of dividing two integers and displays the result.
- Input: `11`, `4`
- Output: `3`

## P09_05CircleArea
Develop a program that calculates the area of a circle using a float input for the radius and displays the result. (probably requires Google for the Maths)
- Input: `2`
- Output: `12,56...`

## P09_06Negation
Write a program that takes an integer input and displays its negation using the unary minus operator.* (requires Googling what the ternary minus operator is)
- Input: `11`
- Output: `-11`

## P09_07Product
Develop a program that takes two integers as input and calculates their product using the multiplication operator.
- Input: `11`, `4`
- Output: `44`

## P09_08BMI
Develop a program that calculates the BMI of a person using their weight in kilograms and height in meters. Display the BMI value. (probably requires google for the Maths)
- Input: `70`, `1,82`
- Output: `21,13...`

## P09_09Hypotenuse
Develop a program that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the lengths of the other two sides as inputs. Display the result.* (requires Google for the Square Root)
- Input: `3`, `4`
- Output: `5`

## P09_10SecondsToMinutes
Write a program that takes an integer input representing seconds and converts it to minutes and remaining seconds, then displays the result.
- Input: `111`
- Output: `1 minute(s) and 51 second(s)`
