## Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P9Operators` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Solve this Mathematic problem using code and output the result: 

- Ask the user for an amount of seconds
- Simplify the time:
- Calculate, how many days, hours, minutes and seconds the time contains
  - You need Division and Remainder after Division!
- Print each part of the time
- Then, print all components together in the format `D.H:M:S`
  - `D`ays
  - `H`ours
  - `M`inutes
  - `S`econds
- Then, print how many days that is in total as a fraction
