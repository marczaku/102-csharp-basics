# Exercises 10 - Booleans

## Goal
```
Output:What's your age?
Input:31
Output:You are a child: False
Output:You are a teenager: False
Output:You are an adult: True
```

## Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P10Boolean` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Ask the user for his age. Save it to a variable named `age`
- First, do a few age-checks:
  - Save to a `bool`-variable named `isChild`, whether the age is between 0 and 12
  - Save to a `bool`-variable named `isTeenager`, whether the age is between 13 and 19
  - Save to a `bool`-variable named `isAdult`, whether the age is greater 19
- Then, print them all to the console like this:
  - `You are a child: True` etc. (see sample below)
