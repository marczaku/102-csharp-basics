## Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P12Random` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Ask the User for a Seed and store it in a variable.
- Initialize Random with the given Seed.
- Get three Random Numbers between 0 and 5 (including 0, excluding 5) and print them to the Console.
- Get three Random Numbers between 0 and 0.5 (including 0, excluding 0.5) and print them to the Console.
- Get three Random Numbers between 0.2 and 0.7 (including 0.2, excluding 0.7) and print them to the Console.
- Ask the user for a Crit Chance between 0.0 (0%) and 1.0 (100%). 
  - Then simulate 5 Attacks and write, whether itâ€™s a Crit. Or No Crit. 
- Hint: Thanks to using the Seed, you should actually receive the same results as me below, if using the same Seed. Test it! :)
