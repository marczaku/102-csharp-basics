## Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P11IfElse` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Ask the user for his age
- Print one of these statements (the correct one): 
  - You are an adult
  - You are a child 
  - You are a teenager

- Ask the user for another integer
- Tell him, which is the greater number, the number just given, or his age
- Tell him, whether the greater number is 
  - an even (like 2 4 6) number
  - an odd (like 1 3 5) number
- Hint: How you can find out, whether a number is even or odd?
- Hint: There is an arithmetic operator on the operators-slide that helps you here :)
- Hint: Don't feel ashamed asking another student or googling `How to find out if a number is even c#`
- BONUS: Do the age-task using the ternary operator
