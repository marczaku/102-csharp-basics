## 13. While Loops
### while

- You can use the `while`-keyword in combination with a `bool`-expression to form
  - a loop that repeats
  - as long as the `bool`-expression returns true
- The syntax is as follows:
```cs
while(condition-expression){ // while-scope-start
  // put the code here, that you want to repeat while the bool-expression is true
} // while-scope-end
```
- In the following example, the numbers `0`, `1` and `2` are printed to the console
- When `i` reaches the value `3`
  - the expression `i < 3` 
  - becomes `3 < 3` 
  - which is `false`
  - therefore, the loop is interrupted and the code continues outside the loop
```cs
int i = 0;

while (i < 3)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i); // print i to the console
  i++; // increase i by 1
}
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
```
- Here is another example, where the application asks the user to agree.
- It repeats the request until the user finally types in "yes".
```cs
bool userHasAgreed = false;
// Repeat the loop while the user has not agreed, yet.
while(userHasAgreed == false)
{
  // Ask the uer to agree.
  Console.WriteLine("Please agree by writing 'yes'");
  // If the user types in "yes"...
  if(Console.ReadLine() == "yes")
  {
    // Then we take it as an agreement.
    userHasAgreed = true;
  }
}
```

### do..while

- `do`..`while`-loops are very similar to `while`-loops
- but while `while`-loops first check the condition and then execute the code...
- `do`..`while`-loops first execute the code and then check the condition
  - Therefore, the code in the loop is guaranteed to execute AT LEAST once!
```cs
do { // while-scope-start
  // put the code here, that you want to repeat while the bool-expression is true
} // while-scope-end 
while (condition-expression); 
```
- This example shows the difference pretty well:
```cs
int i = 100;

do {
  // First, print the current number
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
while (i < 3); // Then, check, if the current Number is still smaller than 3. If not, interrupt.
```

Output:
```
100
```
- This time, the number 100 was still printed, because it was printed first, and then it was checked, whether it's smaller than 3.
- While the while loop would first check, whether 100 is smaller than 3 and then not print the number anymore.
- Here is the user agreement example again, this time written as a do..while loop:
```cs
bool userHasAgreed;
do
{
  // Ask the uer to agree.
  Console.WriteLine("Please agree by writing 'yes'");
  // If the user types in "yes"...
  if(Console.ReadLine() == "yes")
  {
    // Then we take it as an agreement.
    userHasAgreed = true;
  } else {
    userHasAgreed = false;  
  }
}
while(userHasAgreed == false); // Repeat the loop while the user has not agreed, yet.
```
