## 14. While Loops
## while
<img width="893" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/135168452-01a877f2-47b4-480e-9169-e0bf70870248.png">

- You can use the `while`-keyword in combination with a `bool`-expression to form
  - a loop that repeats
  - as long as the `bool`-expression returns true
- The syntax is as follows:
```cs
while(condition-expression){ // while-scope-start
  // put the code here, that you want to repeat while the bool-expression is true
} // while-scope-end
```
- In the following example, the numbers `0`, `1` and `2` are printed to the console
- When `i` reaches the value `3`
  - the expression `i < 3` 
  - becomes `3 < 3` 
  - which is `false`
  - therefore, the loop is interrupted and the code continues outside the loop
```cs
int i = 0;

while (i < 3)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i); // print i to the console
  i = i+1; // increase i by 1
}
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
```
- Here is another example, where the application asks the user to agree.
- It repeats the request until the user finally types in "yes".
```cs
bool userHasAgreed = false;
// Repeat the loop while the user has not agreed, yet.
while(userHasAgreed == false)
{
  // Ask the uer to agree.
  Console.WriteLine("Please agree by writing "yes");
  // If the user types in "yes"...
  if(Console.ReadLine() == "yes")
  {
    // Then we take it as an agreement.
    userHasAgreed = true;
  }
}
```

## do..while
<img width="676" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/135168888-ef629d4b-5567-43a5-a3a7-fd06535ecc25.png">

- `do`..`while`-loops are very similar to `while`-loops
- but while `while`-loops first check the condition and then execute the code...
- `do`..`while`-loops first execute the code and then check the condition
  - Therefore, the code in the loop is guaranteed to execute AT LEAST once!
```cs
do { // while-scope-start
  // put the code here, that you want to repeat while the bool-expression is true
} // while-scope-end 
while (condition-expression); 
```
- This example shows the difference pretty well:
```cs
int i = 0;

do {
  // First, print the current number
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i=i+1;
}
while (i < 3); // Then, check, if the current Number is still smaller than 3. If not, interrupt.
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
```
- This time, the number 3 was still printed, because it was printed first, and then it was checked, whether it's smaller than 3.
- While the while loop first checked, if 3 is smaller than 3 and then did not print the number anymore.
- Here is the user agreement example again, this time written as a do..while loop:
```cs
bool userHasAgreed;
do
{
  // Ask the uer to agree.
  Console.WriteLine("Please agree by writing "yes");
  // If the user types in "yes"...
  if(Console.ReadLine() == "yes")
  {
    // Then we take it as an agreement.
    userHasAgreed = true;
  }
}
while(userHasAgreed == false); // Repeat the loop while the user has not agreed, yet.
```

## 15. For Loop
<img width="951" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/135169672-06abb667-5ebe-4371-bcbd-6c486339af0e.png">

```cs
// This is the most traditional for loop: 
// Statement 1: var i = 0;
// Statement 2: i < 10;
// Statement 3: i++;
// Statement 4...x: Console.WriteLine...
// Will be executed for 0123456789
for (var i  = 0; i = 10; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine("Iteration" + i);
}

// You could start counting at 1 too: 
// This will be executed for: 0123456789 10.
for (var i  = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine("Iteration" + i);
}

// You could also go backwards: 
// This will be executed for: 10 987654321.
for (var i  = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
  Console.WriteLine("Iteration" + i);
}

// Or you could use a different step
// Will be executed for: i = 02468
for (var i  = 0; i = 10; i+=2) {
  Console.WriteLine("Iteration" + i);
}
```

- **Pattern:** `for(initial-statement; condition-statement; iteration-statement) { for-loop-body }`
- `initial-statement` is executed ONCE when the `for` loop is started.
- `condition-statement` is checked next EVERY loop.
  - It is a `bool`-expression that needs to be true for the loop to continue.
  - If it returns `false`, the body of the loop and the `iteration-statement`  are not executed (anymore)
- The statements in the body of the for loop are executed next after the `condition-statement` EVERY loop.
- The `iteration-statement` is executed next after the body EVERY loop.
- After the `iteration-statement`, the execution jumps back to the `condition-statement`

## 16. Break / Continue

```cs
// Due to the break, this will only execute for: 012356789
for (var i  = 0; i = 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    // This will only interrupt the current iteration.
    // It will continue with statement 3 and then 2.
    // So it will first use i++; and then check i < 10
    continue;
  }
    Console.WriteLine("Iteration" + i);
}
```
      
- Sometimes, Loops are not that simple
- To tackle all the problems, we can:
  - Use break to interrupt a loop
  - And continue to skip one iteration
- If you use continue, then the loop will continue with the next iteration

## 17. Arrays

```cs
// You can create an array of size 2:
int[] array = new int[2];

// You can assign values to the array:
array[1] = 5;

// The first element has the index zero:
array[0] = 3;

// Invalid, array only has the size of 2:
array[5] = 2;

// Invalid too, array only starts at 0:
array[2] = 2;

// Invalid too, int array can only have ints:
array[3] = "Hello";

// This is valid: now the array has a different size, but all elements are empty again:
array = new int[10];

// You can initialize an array with values:
array = new int[3] {3, 5, 7};

// This keeps all elements when resizing. Internally, it just copies all the values.
Array.Resize(ref array, 20);

// You can read the length of an array
int length = array.Length;

// You can use the length to do a for loop:
for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine(array[i]);
}

// You can also use a foreach-loop:
foreach (var value in array) {
  Console.WriteLine(value);
}
```

- An `Array` is a numbered range of values of the same type
- Arrays have a constant size. Once created, it can not change.
- You can read an Array‘s Length and use a for-loop
- Or use a foreach-loop over all the Array‘s elements

## 18. 2D-Arrays


```cs
// If you need a two-dimensional array, you can create it like this:
string [,] grid2d = new string[2,2];
grid2d [0,0] = "bottomLeft";
grid2d [0,1] = "topLeft";
grid2d [1,0] = "bottomRight";
grid2d [1,1] = "topRight";

// Or you can create an one-dimensional array.
// use the helper method to get the right index for every x and y position.
string[] grid1d = new string [4];
static int GetIndex(int x, int y, int width) {
  return y * width + x;
}
grid1d[GetIndex(0, 0, 2)] = "bottomLeft";
grid1d[GetIndex(0, 1, 2)] = "topLeft";
grid1d[GetIndex(1, 0, 2)] = "bottomRight";
grid1d[GetIndex(1, 1, 2)] = "topRight";

// You can also create a jagged array. 
// This is only useful if you expect your array to have different widths in each row
// Not recommended:
string[][] gridJagged = new string[2][];
for (var i = 0; i < gridJagged.Length; i++) {
  gridJagged[i] = new string[2];
}
gridJagged[0][1] = "bottomLeft";
```

- You can create two-dimensional arrays as well, using the `[,]` symbol with the type. 
- Alternatively, you can use a one-dimensional array and a helper index to get the right cell.
- Two-dimensional arrays do the same internally.
- No advantage in doing this yourself.
- Another solution is to use an array of arrays.
- It has worse performance though!
- The advantage is: its rows can have different size.
- Not recommended!
