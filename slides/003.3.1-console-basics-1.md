# 003.3.1 Console Basics 1

## 0. Basics

- C# Code is executed from top to bottom.
- Every statement in C# needs to be separated by a Semicolon.
- Empty statements are okay.

```cs
Console.WriteLine("First.");
Console.WriteLine("Second.");
;
```

Output:
```
First.
Second.
```

- The language cares about whitespaces, tabs and newlines only as a way to separate words.
```cs
name space Foo { // WRONG
}

namespaceFoo { // WRONG
}

namespace Foo { // CORRECT
}
```

- But it does not really care about your formatting
``` cs
namespace Foo{} // OKAY

namespace    
Foo {} // OKAY

namespace Foo
{
} // OKAY

Console.WriteLine("Hi"); // OKAY
Console.WriteLine(
  "Hi"
)
; // OKAY
```

## 1. Printing Output

- You can simply access `Console` class‚Äòs static method `WriteLine`, passing a string parameter:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
// Output: Hello World!
```

- Or also other types of parameter (`int`, `bool`, or any other, really:
```cs
Console.WriteLine(5);
// Output: 5
``` 

- If you don't want a New Line after your Output, use `Write` instead:
```cs
Console.Write("Hello");
Console.Write("World");
Console.Write(5);
// Output: HelloWorld5
```

---

## 2. Comments



- Comments are used for documentation or for explaining complex or undescriptive code.
```cs
// This is a single-line comment.
int x = 5;
int x1 = 3; // Everything in the same line after this symbol becomes a comment.
// Comments are ignored by the Compiler

/* This is a multi-line comment,
int y = 5;
it ends only here */

/* Multi-line comments don't work like braces. /* One ending tag /* is enough to end even multiple oopening tags. */

int z = 5;

// Another use of multi-line comments:
Console.Write(/*x+y+z*/"Test");
```
- Well-written code does not require many comments.
```cs
public class Car {
   // Gets the Speed of the car. <- not a good comment!
   public int GetSpeed() {
      // needs to be multiplied with 3.61 to convert from mp/h to km/h <- good comment! Explains something that might have been cryptic else.
      return rigidbody.GetVelocity().magnitude * 3.61;
   }
}
```
- If you write a library (reusable, modular code), your public `API` should be documented in `XML`.
```cs
///<summary>
/// This is an XML documentation comment.
/// It will show up in your IDE's tooltips.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="args"> It has cool features, like giving infos on parameters. </param>
static void Main(string[] args)
{}
```
- There are exporters for `XML` documentation comments to generate `HTML` or `PDF`s.
- Comments are ignored by the compilers. So, this code here:
```cs
public void DoStuff(){
   Console.WriteLine("a");
   // Console.WriteLine("b");
   Console.WriteLine("c");
}
```
Looks to the compiler like this:
```cs
public void DoStuff(){
   Console.WriteLine("a");
   
   Console.WriteLine("c");
}
```
- As an experienced programmer, you want to avoid spamming your code with unnecessary comment spam
- As an inexperienced programmer, you just want to make sure to understand next week, what you've done last week
  - So don't feel bad for putting a lot of comments in your code :)
- Learn your IDE's shortcuts for commenting / uncommenting code.
  - e.g. `Cmd` + `/` on Rider (Mac) or `Ctrl` + `K`, `Ctrl` + `C` on Windows

## 3. Variables

- Variables are a bit like a phone contact list:
- There is a variable name (contact name üë§) and a value (phone number ‚òéÔ∏è) is assigned to it 
```cs
string marc = "07081716161";
```
- Now, if you use this üë§ variable, then the ‚òéÔ∏è value for that üë§ variable name is looked up and used:
```cs
Console.WriteLine(marc); // Output: 07081716161
```
- Remember, not to put quotation marks around your üë§ variable names, when you want to use the ‚òéÔ∏è variable values:
```
Console.WriteLine("marc"); // Output: marc
```
- We can have different üë§ variables with different ‚òéÔ∏è values, too:
```cs
string anna = "07303937390";
```

- Also, we can assign new ‚òéÔ∏è values to existing üë§ variable:
```cs
marc = "07119181881"; // Now, the value for marc has changed.
Console.WriteLine(marc); // Output: 07119181881
```


- Variables are used to store data
- Variables consist of a _type_ and a _name_
```cs
// You can declare a variable
int x;
```

- You can access variables for reading and writing using their name
- You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator `=`
```cs
// You can assign a variable
x = 5;

// You can use a variable
Console.WriteLine(x); // This prints 5

// You can not use an uassigned variable
int y;
Console.WriteLine(y); // This gives an error

// You can assign a variable on definition
int z = 5;
Console.WriteLine(z); // This prints 5

// You can assign a new value to a variable 
z = 10;
Console.WriteLine(z); // This prints 10
```

- A variable is valid within its scope, that is, between the previous `{` and the matching `}`
```cs
public static void Main() { // Variable scope start
  int a = 5;
  {
    Console.WriteLine(a); // Valid, because this scope is nested within the variable's scope
  }
} // Variable scope end
```x

```cs
  int z = 2;
  // You can not use the same variable name before the end of the curly brackets surrounding the defined variable
  int z = 3; // This gives an error
}
// After the curly brackets, this is is fine again:
int z;
```
- But it is only usuable after the line where it is declared
```cs
public static void Main() { // Variable scope start
  Console.WriteLine(a); // ERROR, you can only use a in the line AFTER it has been defined.
  int a = 5; // This is, where it is declared.
} // Variable scope end
```

- Outside of the scope, you can **not** access the variable (at least not directly)

```cs
public static void Main() {
  {
    int a = 5;
  }
  Console.WriteLine(a); // Error, a is not defined in this scope.
}
```

## 4. Basic Data Types

- C# is a **type-safe** language.
- You use different types to represent different data.
- Most basic types should be clear in their usage.
```cs
// Whole numers
int age = 5;

// Fractional numbers
float interestRate = 0.025f;

// More precise fractionals
double bacteriaSize = 24e-10;

// True or false flag
bool isWinning = false;

// One single character
char euroSign = '‚Ç¨';

// A full string
string name = "Marc";

// A multiline string
string starWarsIntro = @"Star Wars
Episode IV:
A New Hope";

// Interpolated string
string response = $"Welcome {name}";
```

- Bytes are mostly used to 
  - store small numbers (and save memory)
  - represent Data; Binary or Text; read from or written to Files or Network
```cs
// One byte
byte someByte = 0xF1;
```


---

## 5. Conversion

```cs
// Some types can be cast implicitly
int i = 5;
double d = 1; // New value: 5.0
d = 9.78;

// Some can only be cast explicitly. The reason is that converting a fractional number to a whole number comes with a loss of precision
i = (int) d; // new value: 9
string input = "2";

// Some need to be converted. Conversions are validated and will throw exceptions. If invalid, e.g is the string is "Tom".
i = Convert.ToInt32(input); // New value: 2
```

- Conversions are often necessary while computing.
- For example Console Input `string` needs to be converted to a number
- Or an `integer` needs to be converted to a `float` to do division with decimals
- There‚Äòs a variety of ways of doing that, you should always choose the easiest
path that‚Äòs available for your conversion

---

## 6. Reading Input
```cs
string input = Console.ReadLine();
```
- You can simply access Console class‚Äòs static method `ReadLine`
- Then save the return value of the method into a variable, or use it otherwise

## 7. Operators

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  int x = 5 + 5; // x = 10
  int y = x + 5; // y = 15
  int z = y + y; // z = 30
  Console.WriteLine(z + z); // 60
}
```

- Operators are functions represented by symbols
- They execute operations and return a result
- The result can be assigned to a variable, or used directly

```cs
int add = 3 + 5; // 8
int sub = 6 - 12; // -6
int mul = 3 * 4; // 12
int div = 9 / 3; // 3

// Modulo returns the rest after division:
// 10 / 3 = 3 (+1 rest)
// Proof 3 * 3 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10

int mod = 10 % 3; // = 1
```
```cs
public class Coin {
  public static Coins operator+ (Coin a, Coin b) {
    return new Coins (a, b);
  }
  
  void sample () {
    Coins coins = new Coin() + new Coin();
  }
}
```

- Arithmetic operators are used for mathematical operations
- They take two numbers as input and return a number as output
- They may sometimes accept other types as input, if custom operators were implemented
