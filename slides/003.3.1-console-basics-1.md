# 003.3.1 Console Basics 1

In this Chapter, we will learn all the basics for writing small C# Console Applications, in which we can display text in the Console Window, ask the User for Input and store, modify and convert different kinds of data, like Text and Number.

- [1. Printing Output](#1-Printing-Output)
- [2. Comments](#2-Comments)
- [3. Variables](#3-Variables)
- [4. Basic Data Types](#4-Basic-Data-Types)
- [5. Conversion](#5-Conversion)
- [6. Reading Input](#6-Reading-Input)
- [7. Operators](#7-Operators)

## 0. Script Execution

- C# Code is executed from top to bottom.
- Every statement in C# needs to be separated by a Semicolon `;`
- Empty statements are okay.

```cs
Console.WriteLine("First.");
Console.WriteLine("Second.");
;
```

Output:
```
First.
Second.
```

- The language cares about whitespaces, tabs and newlines only as a way to separate words.
```cs
name space Foo { // WRONG
}

namespaceFoo { // WRONG
}

namespace Foo { // CORRECT
}
```

- But it does not really care about your formatting
``` cs
namespace Foo{} // OKAY

namespace    
Foo {} // OKAY

namespace Foo
{
} // OKAY

Console.WriteLine("Hi"); // OKAY
Console.WriteLine(
  "Hi"
)
; // OKAY
```

## 1. Printing Output

Our Applications often are only worth as much as the user gets to see from it. While we will learn later, that some application's result is not necessarily output to the console, but maybe files that are deleted, renamed or created, the output of text to the console is still the most common and most classic response that a user can receive when running a Console Application.

- You can simply access `Console` class‘s static method `WriteLine`, passing a string parameter:

### Console.WriteLine
```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
// Output: Hello World!
```

- Or also other types of parameters (`int`, `bool`, or any other, really)
  - We will learn more about different types soon!
- Here, we are passing a number (`int`):
```cs
Console.WriteLine(5);
// Output: 5
``` 

### Console.Write
- If you don't want a New Line after your Output, use `Write` instead:
```cs
Console.Write("Hello");
Console.Write("World");
Console.Write(5);
// Output: HelloWorld5
```

---

## 2. Comments

Comments are used for documentation or for explaining complex or undescriptive code.

### Single-Line Comments
- The most traditional comment is a simple single-line comment, started with `//`:
```cs
// This is a single-line comment.
int x = 5;
int x1 = 3; // Everything in the same line after this symbol becomes a comment.
// Even code gets ignored: Console.WriteLine("HelloWorld!"); will not do anything.
// Comments are ignored by the Compiler
```

### Multi-Line Comments
- Another useful tool for larger comments are multi-line comments.
- They are started by using the `/*`
- And they end at the next occurence of a `*/`
```cs
/* This is a multi-line comment,
int y = 5;
it ends only here */

/* Multi-line comments don't work like braces. 
        /* One 
           ending 
       tag */ is enough to end even multiple opening tags. */

int z = 5;

// Another use of multi-line comments:
Console.Write(/*x+y+z*/"Test");
```

### XML Documentation Comments
- If you write a library (reusable, modular code), your public `API` should be documented in `XML`.
- There are exporters for `XML` documentation comments to generate `HTML` or `PDF`s.
```cs
///<summary>
/// This is an XML documentation comment.
/// It will show up in your IDE's tooltips.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="args"> It has cool features, like giving infos on parameters. </param>
static void Main(string[] args)
{}
```

### Comments and Compilation
Comments are ignored by the compilers. So, this code here:
```cs
public void DoStuff(){
   Console.WriteLine("a");
   // Console.WriteLine("b");
   Console.WriteLine("c");
}
```

Looks to the compiler like this:
```cs
public void DoStuff(){
   Console.WriteLine("a");
   
   Console.WriteLine("c");
}
```

### Commenting Guidelines

- Well-written code does not require many comments.
```cs
public class Car {
   // Gets the Speed of the car. <- not a good comment!
   public int GetSpeed() {
      // needs to be multiplied with 3.61 to convert from mp/h to km/h <- good comment! Explains something that might have been cryptic else.
      return rigidbody.GetVelocity().magnitude * 3.61;
   }
}
```

- As an experienced programmer, you want to avoid spamming your code with unnecessary comment spam
- As an inexperienced programmer, you just want to make sure to understand next week, what you've done last week
  - So don't feel bad for putting a lot of comments in your code :)
- Learn your IDE's shortcuts for commenting / uncommenting code.
  - e.g. `Cmd` + `/` on Rider (Mac) or `Ctrl` + `K`, `Ctrl` + `C` on Windows

## 3. Variables

Variables are used to store information in C#. We need variables to keep track of all kinds of information that our applications need. Imagine a game of chess, for example. We would need variables to store all the pieces that are part of the Game, as well as their positions, the information, whose turn it is. We can then access the information, so we can display the Chess Board to the player, and we can alsso change the information stored in those variables when the players make moves on the board.

- Variables are a bit like a phone contact list.
- In the following explaination, we will use
  - A Contact Name 👤 as a metaphor for a variable's name.
  - A Phone Number ☎️ as a metaphor for a variable's value.

- There is a 👤 and a ☎️ is assigned to it 
```cs
string marc = "07081716161";
```
- Now, if you use this 👤, then the ☎️ for that 👤 is looked up and used:
```cs
Console.WriteLine(marc); // Output: 07081716161
```
- Remember, not to put quotation marks around your 👤, when you want to use the ☎️:
```
Console.WriteLine("marc"); // Output: marc
```
- We can have different 👤 with different ☎️, too:
```cs
string anna = "07303937390";
string tom = "0711223311";
```

- Also, we can assign new ☎️ to existing 👤:
```cs
marc = "07119181881"; // Now, the ☎️ for 👤 marc has changed.
Console.WriteLine(marc); // Output: 07119181881
```

### Variable Declaration
- Variables are used to store data
- Variables consist of a Type and a Name. (More on Types in the next Chapter)
- This is, how you declare a variable:
```cs
int money;
```

### Variable Assignment
- You can access variables for reading and writing using their name
- You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator `=`
```cs
money = 5;
```

### Variable Access
- You can access a variable through it's variable name, too.
- When you access a variable, you access its value.
- In the following code, when accessing the `money` variable, we access its value, which is `5`:
```cs
Console.WriteLine(money); // This prints 5
```

### Variable Initialization
- Whenever a variable is assigned (`=`) a value for the first time
- We call it Initialization
- Before a variable has been initialized, we cannot access it:

```cs
// You can not use an uninitialized variable
int y;
Console.WriteLine(y); // ERROR: Cannot access uninitialized variable.
```

- You can initialize a variable directly when defining it:
```cs
int score = 99;
Console.WriteLine(score); // This prints 99
```

- You can assign a new value to a variable anytime:
```
score = 30;
Console.WriteLine(z); // This prints 30
score = 10;
Console.WriteLine(z); // This prints 10
```

### Multiple Declarations
You can declare multiple variables of the same type by separating the variable names by a comma `,`:
```cs
int a, b, c;
```

But careful, if you assign a value right away, it only gets assigned to the right-most variable.
- `a`: uninitialized
- `b`: uninitialized
- `c`: 2
```c
int a, b, c = 2;
```

### Multiple Assignments
You can do multiple assignments.\
Assignments are right-associative, which means, that they are evaluated from right to left:
- First: `c = 5`
- Second: `b = c` (which is `5`)
- Third: `a = b` (which is `5`)
```cs
int a = 1;
int b = 2;
int c = 3;
a = b = c = 5;
```

## 3.1 Scope

Scopes are a very important concept in C#. Imagine a huge application like World of Warcraft. The code must contain Millions of variables. You might imagine, that after a short amount of time, all variable names would be in use already. To avoid conflicts here, variables only exist within a limited scope of the application, whereever it is needed. It is similar to Family Names and addresses. How many people in your country have the same Family Name? But that's no problem for our Addresses. Within the same house, it is very unlikely, that multiple people have the same Family Name. And if they do, then they usually put their first name's first letter on the Mailbox, too. In this example, the Family name would be a variable, and the House's address the scope.

### Scope Delimiter
- Scopes in C# are started using `{` and ended using `}`
```cs
public static void Main() { // Method Scope Start
  int a = 5;
} // Method Scope End
```

### Nested Scopes
- Scopes can be nested. Every `{` must have  matching `}`
- Each `}` closes the closest, unclosed `}`:

```cs
{ // Scope A Start
   { // Scope B Start
   } // Scope B End
   
   { // Scope C Start
   } // Scope C End
} // Scope A End
```

### Variable Scope
- A variable is valid within its scope only, that is, between the previous `{` and the matching `}`

```cs
public static void Main() { // Variable `a` Scope Start
  int a = 5; // `a` is declared here, its scope is the closest, previous `{`
  {
    Console.WriteLine(a); // `a` is still valid within the nested scope
  }
} // Variable `a` Scope End
```

- Outside of the scope, you can NOT access the variable!
```cs
public static void Main() {
  {
    int a = 5;
  }
  Console.WriteLine(a); // Error, a is not defined in this scope.
}
```

- You can NOT declare two variables with the same name within the same scope:
```cs
{
  int z = 2;
  int z = 3; // ERROR: Variable named `z` is declared already
}
{
   int z; // This is Valid again, the previous `z` variable's Scope has ended already.
}
```

- But of course, you can still assign new values to existing variables:

```cs
{
  int z = 2;
  z = 3; // This is fine, we assign a new value to the existing variable.
}
```

- A variable is only usuable after the line where it is declared
```cs
public static void Main() { // Variable scope start
  Console.WriteLine(a); // ERROR, you can only use `a` in the line AFTER it has been declared.
  int a = 5; // This is, where it is declared.
} // Variable scope end
```

## 4. Basic Data Types

- C# is a **type-safe** language.
- You use different types to represent different data.
- Most basic types should be clear in their usage.
```cs
// Whole numers
int age = 5;

// Fractional numbers
float interestRate = 0.025f;

// More precise fractionals
double bacteriaSize = 24e-10;

// True or false flag
bool isWinning = false;

// One single character
char euroSign = '€';

// A full string
string name = "Marc";

// A multiline string
string starWarsIntro = @"Star Wars
Episode IV:
A New Hope";

// Interpolated string
string response = $"Welcome {name}";
```

- Bytes are mostly used to 
  - store small numbers (and save memory)
  - represent Data; Binary or Text; read from or written to Files or Network
```cs
// One byte
byte someByte = 0xF1;
```


---

## 5. Conversion

```cs
// Some types can be cast implicitly
int i = 5;
double d = 1; // New value: 5.0
d = 9.78;

// Some can only be cast explicitly. The reason is that converting a fractional number to a whole number comes with a loss of precision
i = (int) d; // new value: 9
string input = "2";

// Some need to be converted. Conversions are validated and will throw exceptions. If invalid, e.g is the string is "Tom".
i = Convert.ToInt32(input); // New value: 2

input = "2.3";
d = Convert.ToDouble(input); // New Value: 2.3

// Warning: Parsing numbers is dependant on your system's Regional Settings
// In Sweden and Germany, for example, Decimal numbers are written 2,3 instead of 2.3
// If you try converting a number in the wrong format, you will see this error instead:
//    Unhandled exception. System.FormatException: Input string was not in the correct format.
// (Even though, other format errors would result in the same error, e.g. trying to convert "Hello" to a  number)
// To always convert numbers using the Internal Standard Notation (2.3), use this instead:
d = Convert.ToDouble(input, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
```

- Conversions are often necessary while computing.
- For example Console Input `string` needs to be converted to a number
- Or an `integer` needs to be converted to a `float` to do division with decimals
- There‘s a variety of ways of doing that, you should always choose the easiest
path that‘s available for your conversion

---

## 6. Reading Input
```cs
string input = Console.ReadLine();
```
- You can simply access Console class‘s static method `ReadLine`
- Then save the return value of the method into a variable, or use it otherwise

## 7. Operators

- Operators are functions represented by symbols
- They execute operations and return a result
- The result can be assigned to a variable, or used directly

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  int x = 5 + 5; // x = 10
  int y = x + 5; // y = 15
  int z = y + y; // z = 30
  Console.WriteLine(z + z); // 60
}
```

### Arithmetic Operators

- Arithmetic operators are used for mathematical operations
- They take two numbers as input and return a number as output

```cs
int add = 3 + 5; // 8
int sub = 6 - 12; // -6
int mul = 3 * 4; // 12
int div = 9 / 3; // 3

// Modulo returns the rest after division:
// 10 / 3 = 3 (+1 rest)
// Proof 3 * 3 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10

int mod = 10 % 3; // = 1
```

- They may sometimes accept other types as input, if custom operators were implemented
```cs
Coins coins = new Coin() + new Coin();
}
```

### Operator Precedence

Arithmetic operators are left-associative.\
Generally speaking, this means, thaat operators are evaluated from left to right:
```cs
int result = 8 - 2 - 1; // 5
```

Above sample first solves the first operator:
```cs
int result = (8 - 2) - 1; // 5
```

We can use Parenthesis `()` to change the order of evaluation:
```cs
int result = 8 - (2 - 1); // 7
```

This means, that Paranthesis `()` have precedence over mathematical operators. They have a higher priority and are evaluated first.

Keep in mind, that, just as in Mathematics, Division and Multiplication have higher precedence:
```cs
int result = 4 + 1 * 2; // 6
```

Above code sample is the same as:
```cs
int result = 4 + (1 * 2); // 6
```


### Arithmetic Assignment Operators

- Since we very often use an operator and then assign the value to the same variable
- A shorthand-writing exist for this case:

```cs
int number = 5;
number = number + 3;
```
is the same as:
```cs
int number = 5;
number += 3;
```

same goes for the other operators:
```cs
number /= 2;
number *= 5;
number -= 3;
number %= 9;
```

### Increment and Decrement Operator

And in case you want to increase a number simply by 1
The increment-operator does exactly that, but even shorter:

```cs
int i = 0;
i = i + 1; // increases i by 1
i += 1; // increases i by 1
i++; // increases i by 1
```

The same goes with `-`, too, it's called decrement-operator:
```cs
i--;
```

### Post-Increment and Pre-Increment Operators

Funny enough, there is two ways of using the operator, with slightly different behavior:
```cs
int i = 5;
Console.WriteLine(i++); // 5
Console.WriteLine(i); // 6
```
and
```cs
int i = 5;
Console.WriteLine(++i); // 6
Console.WriteLine(i); // 6
```

As you may have noticed:
- if you write `i++`, then the value is increased by 1, but the value used is still the old one.
  - you can remember this by reading from left to right: i is used, then it is increased (`++`)
  - this is called `post-increment`-operator
- if you write `++i`, then the value is increased by 1 and then the already increased value is used.
  - you can remember this by reading from left to right: i is first increased (`++`) and then it is used.
  - this is called `pre-increment`-operator

```cs
int i = 5;
i++; // this function increases i to 6, but returns 5 (the old value)

i = 5;
++i; // this function increases i to 6 and returns 6 (the new value)
```
