# 003.3.1 Console Basics 1

## 1. Printing Output

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

- You can simply access Console class‘s static method `WriteLine`, passing a string parameter

## 2. Comments

```cs
///<summary>
/// This is an XML documentation comment.
/// It will show up in your IDE's tooltips.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="args"> It has cool features, like giving infos on parameters. </param>

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  // This is a single-line comment
  int x = 5;
  /* This is a multi-line comment,
  int y = 5;
  it ends only here */
  
  /* Multi-line comments don't work like braces. One ending tag is enough to end even multiple oopening tags. */
  
  int z = 5;
  
  // Another use of multi-line comments:
  Console.Write(/*x+y+z*/"Test");
}
```

- Comments are used for documentation or for explaining complex or undescriptive code.
- Well-written code does not require many comments.
- If you write a library (reusable, modular code), your public `API` should be documented in `XML`.
- There are exporters for `XML` documentation comments to generate `HTML` or `PDF`s.

## 3. Variables

```cs
// You can declare a variable
int x;

// You can assign a variable
x = 5;

// You can use a variable
Console.WriteLine(x);

// You can not use an uassigned variable
int y;
Console.WriteLine(y); // This gives an error

// You can assign a variable on definition
int z = 5;

// You can assign a new value to a variable 
z = 10;

// You can not use the same variable name before the end of the curly brackets surrounding the defined variable
int z = 3; // This gives an error
}

//After the curly brackets, this is is fine
int z;
```

- Variables are used to store data
- Variables consist of a _type_ and a _name_
- You can access variables for reading and writing using their name
- You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator `=`
- A variable is valid within its scope, that is, between the previous `{` _and the matching_ `}`
- Outside of the scope, you can **not** access the variable (at least not directly)

## 4. Basic Data Types

```cs
// Whole numers
int age = 5;

// Fractional numbers
float interestRate = 0.025f;

// More precis fractionals
double bacteriaSize = 24e-10;

// True or false flag
bool isWinning = false;

// One single character
char euroSign = "€";

// A full string
string name = "Marc";

// A multiline string
string starWarsIntro = @"Star Wars
Episode IV:
A New Hope";

// Interpolated string
string response = $"Welcome {name}";

// One byte
byte someByte = 0xF1;
```

- C# is a **type-safe** language.
- You use different types to represent different data.
- Most basic types should be clear in their usage.
- Bytes are mostly used to store small numbers (and save memory)
- And to represent Data; Binary or Text; read from or written to Files or Network

## 5. Conversion

```cs
// Some types can be cast implicitly
int i = 5;
double d = 1; // New value: 5.0
d = 9.78;

// Some can only be cast explicitly. The reason is that converting a fractional number to a whole number comes with a loss of precision
i = (int) d; // new value: 9
string input = "2";

// Some need to be converted. Conversions are validated and will throw exceptions. If invalid, e.g is the string is "Tom".
i = Convert.ToInt32(input); // New value: 2
```

- Conversions are often necessary while computing.
- For example Console Input `string` needs to be converted to a number
- Or an `integer` needs to be converted to a `float` to do division with decimals
- There‘s a variety of ways of doing that, you should always choose the easiest
path that‘s available for your conversion

## 6. Reading Input
```cs
string input = Console.ReadLine();
```
- You can simply access Console class‘s static method `ReadLine`
- Then save the return value of the method into a variable, or use it otherwise

## 7. Operators

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  int x = 5 + 5; // x = 10
  int y = x + 5; // y = 15
  int z = y + y; // z = 30
  Console.WriteLine(z + z); // 60
}
```

- Operators are functions represented by symbols
- They execute operations and return a result
- The result can be assigned to a variable, or used directly

```cs
int add = 3 + 5; // 8
int sub = 6 - 12; // -6
int mul = 3 * 4; // 12
int div = 9 / 3; // 3

// Modulo returns the rest after division:
// 10 / 3 = 3 (+1 rest)
// Proof 3 * 3 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10

int mod = 10 % 3; // = 1
```
```cs
public class Coin {
  public static Coins operator+ (Coin a, Coin b) {
    return new Coins (a, b);
  }
  
  void sample () {
    Coins coins = new Coin() + new Coin();
  }
}
```

- Arithmetic operators are used for mathematical operations
- They take two numbers as input and return a number as output
- They may sometimes accept other types as input, if custom operators were implemented
