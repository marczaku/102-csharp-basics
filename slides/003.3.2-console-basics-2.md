## 8. Math

- `System.Math` is a `static` class containing many useful functions for numbers
  - `static` means, it can not be instantiated, you can not write `Math math = new Math();`
- If you want to solve a mathematical problem, see, if there‘s a solution already
- Most of these functions exist for many data types (`int`, `float`, `double`, …)
- Here is an overview of the most commonly used ones:
- `int Max(int, int)` returns the higher of two numbers
```cs
int max = Math.Max(5, 3); // 5, because it is the larger number
```
- `int Min(int, int)` returns the smaller of two numbers
```cs
int min = Math.Min(5, 3); // 3, because it is the smaller number
```
- `double Sqrt(double)` returns the Square Root of a number. You remember? The number, that if multiplied with itself results in the number you put in.
```cs
double sqrt = Math.Sqrt(16); // 4.0, because 4 * 4 = 16
```
- `double Abs(double)` returns the absolute of a number, which is always positive. Useful for calculating distances.
```cs
double abs = Math.Abs(-4.3); // 4.3
```
- `double Round(double)` returns the rounded value of a number (closest integer). Uses statistical rounding, not the one you're used to. Test it for 1.5 and 2.5 :)
```cs
double round = Math.Round(12.6); // 13, because it's the closest integer (0.4 difference), closer than 12 (0.6 difference)
```
- `double Floor(double)` returns the value of the number rounded to the lower integer
```cs
double floor = Math.Floor(12.6); // 12 is the next lower integer
```
- `double Ceiling(double)` returns the value of the number rounded to the higher integer
```cs
double ceil = Math.Ceiling(12.1); // 13 is the next higher integer
```
- `int Clamp(int value, int min, int max)` returns the `value` made fit `min` and `max`
```cs
double clamp = Math.Clamp(15, 0, 10); // The value of 15 fits between 0 and 10 only up to the maximum of 10
```
- `double Pow(double value, double power)` returns the `value` to the power of `power`.
```cs
double pow = Math.Pow(2, 3); // 8, because 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
```

## 9. Strings

- There‘s a series of functions for working with strings.
- The most commonly used ones are shown in the code sample above. 
- You already know, how to define and assign strings
```cs
string firstName = "John";
string lastName = "Kane";
```
- We can get the length of a string returned
```cs
string length = firstName.Length; // 4
```
- We can make a string All-Uppercase or All-Lowercase
```cs
string upper = firstName.ToUpper(); // JOHN
string lower = firstName.ToLower(); // john
```
- We can combine strings into a larger string using the `+`-Operator
```cs
string fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // John Kane
```
- We can combine strings using String-Interpolation. Put the `$`-operator before a string and variables between `{` and `}`
```cs
string interp = $"{firstName} {lastName}"; // John Kane
```
- You can get the character at any index of the string. The first index is `0`
```cs
char char1 = firstName[0]; // 'J'
```
- You can also get the index of the first occurance of a character or string. Again, counting starts at `0`
```cs
int index = firstName.IndexOf("h"); // 2
```
- You can get a sub-part of a string starting at a certain index (1) until the end of the string
```cs
string sub = firstName.SubString(1); // "ohn"
```
- You can get a sub-part of a string starting at a certain index (1) with a certain length (2)
```cs
string sub = firstName.SubString(1, 2); // "oh"
```
- You can replace all occurances of a character or string with another one
```cs
string replace = fullName.Replace( 'n', 'd'); // "Johd Kade"
```
One thing to keep in mind:\
Strings are `immutable`\
That means: A `string` can never be changed.\
So, when you call a function on a variable, it never changes the variable itself.\
Instead, it returns a new string that you can or need to assign to the same, or a new variable.
In other words:
```cs
string fullName = "John Kane";
fullName.Replace('n', 'd');
Console.WriteLine(fullName);
```
Output: John Kane
```cs
string fullName = "John Kane";
fullName = fullName.Replace('n', 'd');
Console.WriteLine(fullName);
```
Output: Johd Kade

## 10. Boolean

## bool Type

- **Booleans** (`bool`) are used to display values, that can be:
  - `YES` or `NO`
  - `ON` or `OFF`
  - `TRUE` or `FALSE`
```cs
bool isWaterBlue = true;
bool isWaterRed = false;
```

## Logical Operators

- You can inverse them by using an exclamation mark `!` (read it as `NOT`
  - `!true` -> `false`
  - `!false` -> `true`
```cs
bool isWaterNotRed = !isWaterRed; // true
```
- You can combine two `bool` values with `&&` (Read: AND) or `||` (Read: OR)
- `&&` only returns `true`, if both incoming values are `true`:
```cs
bool isOfFullAge = true;
bool hasEnoughMoney = true;
// You are only allowed, if you are of full age AND you have enough money:
bool mayBuyBeer = isOfFullAge && hasEnoughMoney; // true
```

```cs
bool isOfFullAge = false;
bool hasEnoughMoney = true;
bool mayBuyBeer = isOfFullAge && hasEnoughMoney; // false, because you are not of Full Age.
```

- `||` returns `true`, if either incoming value is `true`:
```cs
bool hasEnoughMoney = true;
bool canGetALoan = true;
// You are allowed to buy the product, if you either have enough money, or you can get a loan:
bool mayBuyBeer = hasEnoughMoney || canGetALoan; // true
```

```cs
bool hasEnoughMoney = false;
bool canGetALoan = true;
bool mayBuyBeer = hasEnoughMoney || canGetALoan; // true
```

```cs
bool hasEnoughMoney = false;
bool canGetALoan = false;
bool mayBuyBeer = hasEnoughMoney || canGetALoan; // false
```

## Comparison Operators

- Comparision operators can compare two values and return a `bool` (`true` or `false`)
```cs
bool isGreater = 10 > 9; // True
bool isEqual = 10 == 9; // False
bool isNotEqual = 10 != 9; // True
bool isLess = 10 < 9; // False
bool isGreaterOrEqual = 10>= 9; // True
bool isLessOrEqual = 10<= 9; // False
```

## 11. If .. Else

- Using `if`-`else` Blocks with Conditions allows you to write conditional code
- Code, that is only executed, if a condition is met

```cs
if(bool-condition) { // if-scope-start
   // then execute this code
} // if-scope-end
else 
{ // else-scope-start
   // else execute this code
} // else-scope-end
```

- Here is an example of using `if`-`else if`-`else` to print an appropriate Greeting depending on the time:
```cs
int hour = GetHour();
if (hour <12) {
  // If the hour is 0-11
  Console.WriteLine("Good morning!");
}
else if (hour <18) {
  // Else, if the hour is 12-17
  Console.WriteLine("Good Day!");
}
else {
  // If the hour is more than 18
  Console.WriteLine("Good Evening!");
}
```

- If-Statements are also called flow control statements, because you can control the flow of the code.
- Take this code sample, for example:
```cs
int age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
if(age >= 18)
{
  Console.WriteLine("You are grown up!");
} 
else 
{
  Console.WriteLine("Not old enough!");
}
Console.WriteLine("Thanks for visiting!");
```
- The Code Flow can be seen here:

As you can see, the Code Flow (Arrows) changes depending on the condition.\w
Without flow control statements, code simply runs from top to bottom.\
But thanks to `if`..`else` and other flow control statements, we can write dynamic and interactive code!


- The ternary if-operator can be used as a short-cut for `if`-`else`-blocks, when assigning a value:
```cs
string greeting = condition ? then-value : else-value;
string greeting = condition ? true-value : false-value;
```

```cs
string greeting = hour < 12 ? "Good Morning!" : "Good Day!";
```
- Above code sample is the same as:
```cs
string greeting;
if (hour < 12) {
  greeting = "Good Morning!";
}
else {
  greeting = "Good Day!";
}
```

## 12. Random

- Using `.NET`s `Random`-Class allows you to generate random numbers
- The numbers are pseudo-random: 
  - they are using complex mathematical operations to make them appear random*
  - They are guaranteed to be evenly ditributed across all numbers
- You use a seed to determine, which sequence of numbers you want to have
- **That‘s a feature:** we can reproduce the same random numbers if we know the seed. 
  - e.g. for Replays or Multiplayer-Simulations
  - where it's important for the replays to have the same "random" events as the original match

- `Random()` initializes a new `Random` Instance with a Random Seed
```cs
Random random = new Random();
```

- `Random(int seed)` initializes a new `Random` Instance with a Custom Seed
```cs
Random random = new Random(23746);
```

- `int Next(int min, int max)` receives a new random integer between `0` (inclusive) and `5` (exclusive), so either `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` or `4`
```cs
int number = random.Next(0, 5); // [0..5[
```

- `int Next()` gets a random integer between `0` and `int.MaxValue` (1.2 bln)
```cs
int number = random.Next(); // [0..2147483647[
```

- `double NextDouble()` Receive a new randomNumber between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), so anything between 0.000000 and 0.9999999
```cs
double number = random.NextDouble(); // [0.0..1.0[
```

- To receive a number between 0 (inclusive) and 2.3 (exclusive), you can apply this simple mathematical trick:
- You just multiply the number with 2.3, which will scale all the numbers between 0 and 1 to be evenly distributed between 0 and 2.3
```cs
double number = random.NextDouble()*2.3; // [0.0..2.3[
```

- To receive a number between 1.2 (inclusive) and 2.3 (exclusive), it is a bit more complicated:
- You need to multiply the number with 1.1 (2.3-1.2), because that's the range of different numbers you need.
  - This will give you numbers between 0 and 1.1
- Now, you just add 1.2 to that number, which will move all numbers 1.2 higher
  - This will give you numbers between 1.2 and 2.3
```cs
double number = random.NextDouble()*(2.3-1.2)+1.2; // [1.2..2.3[
```
