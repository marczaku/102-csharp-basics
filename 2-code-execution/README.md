# Exercises 2 - Code Execution

### Goal
```
Output:Hello, World!
Output:Hello, World!
Output:Hello, World!
```

### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P2CodeExecution` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Parse in the following code:
```cs
Console.WriteLine("This is line 1.");
Console.WriteLine("This is line 2.");
Console.WriteLine("This is line 3.");Console.WriteLine("This is line 4.");
Console.WriteLine("This is line 5.");


Console.WriteLine("This is line 6.");
```
- Place a breakpoint in the first line of the program
- Debug the Program
- Use `Step Over` to make the Debugger step through the code one expression at a time
- Observe, how it behaves between Line 3 and 4 and Line 5 and 6.
