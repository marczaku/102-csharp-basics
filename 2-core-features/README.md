## 7 - Operators: 

### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P7Operators` [How To?](https://gist.github.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Solve this Mathematic problem using code and output the result: 

```
Add 7 to 5, multiply the result with 3, subtract 6 from that, divide that result by 1.2 and then take the remainder after division with 17 from that
```
- Be careful about the order of execution here!!
  - (remember from Maths classes? Multiplication before Addition etc.?)
- Hint: There is an operator that gets you the remainder after division
### Sample
```
Output:8
```
