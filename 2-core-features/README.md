# Exercises 2 - Core Features

## Goal
Learn about the core language features for interacting with the console and storing and manipulating data using operators.

## 1 - Printing Output: 

### Goal
```
Output:Hello, World!
Output:Welcome to 102 CSharp Basics!
Output:It's easy to print output...
Output:...to the console!
```

## 2 - Comments: 

### Goal
```
Output:Hello, World!
```

### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P2Comments` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- add 3 lines of a comment in the top of the file to list up 
  - the author of the file
  - the date
  - your e-mail address 
  - (this used to be common practice in a bunch of companies, but it has become kind of obsolete due to Version Control Systems providing the same information)

## 6 - Conversion: 

### Goal
```
Output:Give me a number.
Input:5.6
Output:5.6
Output:5
Output: ??? (Observe)
```

### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P6Conversion` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)

- Convert the variable to Type `double`.
- Print the `double` to the Console.
- Convert the double number to type `int`.
- Print the `int` to the console.
- Convert the original variable to type `int`.
- What happens?

## 7 - Operators: 

### Goal
```
Output:8
```

### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P7Operators` [How To?](https://gist\.github\.com/marczaku/a8b3c38c37e8876a46194a73ed24b1f2)
- Solve this Mathematic problem using code and output the result: 

```
Add 7 to 5, multiply the result with 3, subtract 6 from that, divide that result by 1.2 and then take the remainder after division with 17 from that
```
- Be careful about the order of execution here!!
  - (Remember your Maths classes. Multiplication before Addition etc.)
- Hint: There is an operator that gets you the remainder after division
